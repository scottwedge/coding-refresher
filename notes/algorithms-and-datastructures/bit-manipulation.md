## Bit wise operators

| Operation | Operator |
|-----------|----------|
|   AND     |    &     |
|   OR      |    \|    |
|   NOT     |    ~     |
|   XOR     |    ^     |
| Left Shift|    <<    |
| Right Shift|   >>    |

## Bit wise Operators properties

### AND

```
1 & 1 = 1
0 & 0 = 0
1 & 0 = 0
0 & 1 = 0
```

```
 x & 0s = 0
 x & 1s = x
 x & x = x
 ```

### OR

```
1 | 1 = 1
0 | 0 = 0
1 | 0 = 1
0 | 1 = 1
```

```
x | 0s = x
x | 1s = 1s
x | x = x
```

### NOT

```
~1 = 0
~0 = 1
```

### XOR


```
1 ^ 1 = 0
0 ^ 0 = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1
0 ^ 1 = 1
```

```
x ^ 0s = x
x ^ 1s = ~x
x ^ x = 0
```

### Right Shift

- Arthimetic right shift is division by 2
- Here, the sign bit will be preserved and the shifting occurs in the remaining bits (most significant bits)


-70 (negative) in 8 bit representation

| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

-70 >> 1 = -35

| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|


### Left Shift

- Left Shift is multiplication by 2
- Similar to right shift, we shift values to the left and fill the remaininng bits (least significant bits)

-70 (negative) in 8 bit representation

| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

-70 << 1 = -140

| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|


## Number representation

- Computers store numbers as two's complement.
- A positive number is represented as itself.
- A negative number is represented as two's complement of its absolute value with 1 in its sign bit to indicate negative value.
- The binary representation of -K (negative K) as a N-bit number is concat(1, 2<sup>N - 1</sup> - K).
- This is same as flipping all bits except the sign bit and adding one to it (i.e)
For Eg.

7 -> 0111
Two's complement -> sign bit is reserved. so (1000 + 1) = 1001

|   |       |    |        |
|---|-------|----|--------|
| 7 | 0 111 | -1 | 1 111  |
| 6 | 0 110 | -2 | 1 110  |
| 5 | 0 101 | -3 | 1 101  |
| 4 | 0 100 | -4 | 1 100  |
| 3 | 0 011 | -5 | 1 011  |
| 2 | 0 010 | -6 | 1 010  |
| 1 | 0 001 | -7 | 1 001  |
| 0 | 0 000 |    |        |

### 1's complement vs 2's complement

- In 1's complement is flipping of all bits in a number
Eg. 1's complement of 7 -> 0111 is 1000
- To identify negative and positive, 1's complement needs the most significant bit to be reserved. For positive numbers this bit is set to 0. For negative this bit is set to 1.
- Draw back of 1's complement is 0 can be represented as both positive and negative. It needs different handling for positive and negative.


## Bit Hacks

### set a bit

```
num | (1 << pos)
```

- x | 1 is 1.

### Unset or clear 

#### 1 bit

```
num & (~(1 << pos))
```

- x | 0 is 0.

#### unset everything except last n bits

```ruby
num & ((1 << n) - 1)

# 1 << 4 = 0001000 = 16
# 16 - 1 = 0000111
# 
```

### Update a bit with given bit

```
given = is_bit_1? ? 1 : 0
mask = =(1 << i);
(num & mask) I (value << i);
```

### Check if a particular bit is set

```
num & (1<<pos)
```

### To toggle a bit

```
num ^ (1 << pos)
```
